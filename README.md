# Data Visualization and R Programming Fundamentals

This project contains three R scripts that demonstrate foundational programming concepts in R, focusing on basic operations, data manipulation, and visualizations. It includes tasks such as creating vectors, data frames, and matrices, building reusable functions, and generating visualizations to explore patterns and symmetries.

## Features

1. **Basic R Programming**:
   - Demonstrates fundamental operations like variable creation, vector manipulation, data frame summarization, and matrix indexing.
   - Covers indexing, random data generation, and accessing elements in data structures.

2. **Custom GPA Calculator**:
   - Implements a reusable function (`gpaCalculator`) that calculates GPA based on given grades and credit hours.
   - Creates and processes a sample academic transcript stored in a data frame.

3. **Visualization of Symmetry**:
   - Generates visualizations exploring vertical symmetry, horizontal symmetry, and two-fold symmetry.
   - Demonstrates techniques for adding noise and signal to visual data.


## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kobe-Martinez/data-visualization-fundamentals.git
   cd data-visualization-fundamentals
   
2. **Run Scripts**:
   - Open any of the `.R` scripts in R or RStudio
   - Execute the code line by line or run entire sections to see outputs in the console or plots

3. **Output**:
   - Console outputs for calculations, summaries, and GPA results
   - Visualizations showing symmetry and signal/noise relationships
     

## Code Structure

- **Question1.R**:
  
  - Demonstrates basic operations in R, including vectors, data frames, and matrices

## Important Note

This project is designed as an introduction to R programming and data visualization concepts. It focuses on building a strong foundation in data manipulation, creating reusable functions, and exploring patterns through visualization. Users are encouraged to experiment with the code, adjust inputs, and modify functions to deepen their understanding of R.
